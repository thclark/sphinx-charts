# Tell zsh where you want to store history
#     We leave you to decide, but if you put this into a folder that's been mapped
#     into the container, then history will persist over container rebuilds :)
#
#     !!!IMPORTANT!!!
#     Make sure your .zsh_history file is NOT committed into your repository, as it can contain
#     sensitive information. So in this case, you should add
#         .devcontainer/.zsh_history
#     to your .gitignore file.
