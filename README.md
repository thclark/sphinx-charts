# Sphinx Charts

Interactive charts, graphs and figures for sphinx using [plotly v2.8.3](https://plotly.com/) and D3.

[Documentation is here](https://sphinx_charts.readthedocs.io).

## Quick start

See the documentation above for more, but in an nutshell, add the extension to your `conf.py`:

```
extensions = [
    ...
    'sphinx_charts.charts'
]
```

Paste the following into a new file `<your_docs_src_directory>/charts/test.json`:

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "x": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
      "y": [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
    }
  ],
  "layout": {
    "margin": {"t": 15, "b": 30, "r": 15, "l": 35}
  }
}
```

Include the following directive in your `*.rst` file:

```
.. chart:: charts/test.json

    This is the caption of the chart
```

... and away you go!

## Developer notes

**Note: You don't need to pay attention to the following unless you plan to develop sphinx_charts itself.**

### Getting started

1. Click 'use this template' to the top right, and away you go.
2. Search for `{{` in your new repository. Do search and replace for the various terms - it's obvious what they are, like replace `{{github_username}}` with your github username!
3. Set up the license you need in `LICENSE`.
4. If you need to deploy to pypi, you have to do the first deploy manually - travis can't do that for you. [See the packaging instructions](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi).

### Pre-Commit

You need to install pre-commit to get the hooks working. Do:

```
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

Once that's done, each time you make a commit, the following checks are made:

- valid github repo and files
- code style
- import order
- PEP8 compliance
- documentation build

Upon failure, the commit will halt. **Re-running the commit will automatically fix most issues** except:

- The flake8 checks... hopefully over time Black (which fixes most things automatically already) will negate need for it.
- You'll have to fix documentation yourself prior to a successful commit (there's no auto fix for that!!).

You can run pre-commit hooks without making a commit, too, like:

```
pre-commit run black --all-files
```

or

```
# -v gives verbose output, useful for figuring out why docs won't build
pre-commit run build-docs -v
```

### Contributing

- Please raise an issue on the board (or add your \$0.02 to an existing issue) so the maintainers know
  what's happening and can advise / steer you.

- Create a fork of {{library_name}}, undertake your changes on a new branch, (see `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for branch naming conventions). To run tests and make commits,
  you'll need to do something like:

```
git clone <your_forked_repo_address>    # fetches the repo to your local machine
cd sphinx_charts                     # move into the repo directory
pyenv virtualenv 3.6.9 myenv            # Makes a virtual environment for you to install the dev tools into. Use any python >= 3.6
pyend activate myenv                    # Activates the virtual environment so you don't screw up other installations
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt     # Installs the testing and code formatting utilities
pre-commit install                      # Installs the pre-commit code formatting hooks in the git repo
tox                                     # Runs the tests with coverage. NB you can also just set up pycharm or vscode to run these.
```

- Adopt a Test Driven Development approach to implementing new features or fixing bugs.

- Ask the `sphinx_charts` maintainers _where_ to make your pull request. We'll create a version branch, according to the
  roadmap, into which you can make your PR. We'll help review the changes and improve the PR.

- Once checks have passed, test coverage of the new code is >=95%, documentation is updated and the Review is passed, we'll merge into the version branch.

- Once all the roadmapped features for that version are done, we'll release.

### Release process

The process for creating a new release is as follows:

1. Check out a branch for the next version, called `vX.Y.Z`
2. Create a Pull Request into the `master` branch.
3. Undertake your changes, committing and pushing to branch `vX.Y.Z`
4. Ensure that documentation is updated to match changes, and increment the changelog. **Pull requests which do not update documentation will be refused.**
5. Ensure that test coverage is sufficient. **Pull requests that decrease test coverage will be refused.**
6. Ensure code meets style guidelines (pre-commit scripts and flake8 tests will fail otherwise)
7. Address Review Comments on the PR
8. Ensure the version in `setup.py` is correct and matches the branch version.
9. Merge to master. Successful test, doc build, flake8 and a new version number will automatically create the release on pypi.
10. Go to code > releases and create a new release on GitHub at the same SHA.

## Documents

### Building documents automatically

The documentation will build automatically in a pre-configured environment when you make a commit.

In fact, the way pre-commit works, you won't be allowed to make the commit unless the documentation builds,
this way we avoid getting broken documentation pushed to the main repository on any commit sha, so we can rely on
builds working.

### Building documents manually

**If you did need to build the documentation**

Install `doxgen`. On a mac, that's `brew install doxygen`; other systems may differ.

Install sphinx and other requirements for building the docs:

```
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

Run the build process:

```
sphinx-build -b html docs/source docs/build
```
